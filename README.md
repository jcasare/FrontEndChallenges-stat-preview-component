## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt so much more about CSS Grid and how to re-arrange the order of grid items.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  order:2;

}
```

### Continued development

I'd love to continue sharpening my CSS skills and also continue my Full Stack Web development journey.


### Useful resources

- [Reverse order of columns in CSS Grid layout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45383042/reverse-order-of-columns-in-css-grid-layout) - This helped me for understand how grid layouts work. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
